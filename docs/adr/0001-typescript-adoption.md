# ADR 0001: TypeScript Adoption

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The application is currently using JavaScript with React. While the project already has some TypeScript-related dependencies installed (`@types/react` and `@types/react-dom`), the codebase itself is not fully utilizing TypeScript's features. This creates several challenges:

1. Lack of type safety leads to potential runtime errors that could be caught during development
2. Reduced developer experience due to missing IDE support for type checking and autocompletion
3. Difficulty in maintaining and refactoring code without type information
4. Inconsistent code structure due to the absence of type definitions

## Decision

We will adopt TypeScript as the primary language for the music-tracks application. This includes:

1. Converting all existing `.js` and `.jsx` files to `.ts` and `.tsx`
2. Adding proper type definitions for all components, functions, and data structures
3. Configuring TypeScript compiler options for optimal development experience
4. Setting up proper ESLint rules for TypeScript
5. Adding type checking to the CI/CD pipeline

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved code quality through static type checking
- Better developer experience with enhanced IDE support
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Better documentation through type definitions
- Reduced runtime errors
- Improved team collaboration through explicit interfaces

### Negative

- Initial overhead of converting existing JavaScript code to TypeScript
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with TypeScript
- Slightly more verbose code due to type annotations
- Additional build step for type checking

### Neutral

- Need to maintain TypeScript configuration
- Regular updates of type definitions for dependencies

## Implementation Plan

1. Add TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
2. Convert existing files gradually, starting with core components
3. Add type definitions for external dependencies
4. Update build and development scripts
5. Add TypeScript-specific ESLint rules
6. Update CI/CD pipeline to include type checking
